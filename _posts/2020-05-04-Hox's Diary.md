This blog is a **diary** of my exploration into the *Alice's rabbit hole*  [^1].

## Journey
We will start where everything started: 

**Harbin 2014**
when in order to communicate with other people we didn't have any possible languages to support our communication, exept the sketches and drawing, based on their skills in drawing I think it is still a miracle that I survived there.
